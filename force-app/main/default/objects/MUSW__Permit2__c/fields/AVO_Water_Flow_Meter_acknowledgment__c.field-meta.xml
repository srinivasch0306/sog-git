    <inlineHelpText>I understand that PRIOR to the use of my surface source or groundwater well, the surface pump and/or well must have a water flow meter correctly installed and that an operable water use meter is required as a condition of withdrawing water for agricultural use. (EPD recommends checking with an irrigation dealer for installation requirements specific to your meter make and model.)  In addition, I understand that water withdrawal may not commence until a flow meter is installed on each source and approved.</inlineHelpText>
