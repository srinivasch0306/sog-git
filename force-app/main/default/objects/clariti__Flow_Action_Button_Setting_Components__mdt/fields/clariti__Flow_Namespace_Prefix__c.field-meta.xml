    <description>For a managed flow, we will need to provide both the namespace and the flow API name - those are the two identifiers needed by our code logic to find the flow and then launch it.

For a custom/unmanaged flow, we will only need to provide the flow API name - since the flow is custom, it doesn’t have a namespace that is unique to it (it just inherits the org’s namespace, if any), so the API name is enough for our logic to find and launch it.</description>
